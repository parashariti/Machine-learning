# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is used when output Y is a real number. Consider this simple example of X and Y. 
Here Y is twice of X.

|Input X|Output Y|
|5| 10|
|10| 20|

Consider another example. Here Y follows a straight line equation **Y = MX + C**. So M is 2 and C is 5

|Input X|Output Y|
|5| 15 |
|10| 25|
|15| 35|
|20| 45|
|25| 55|

In both the examples Y is a number, A continous value. So in Linear Regression ML we have X and Y and we try to find M and C.
This Linear regression can be further extended to two Inputs X1 and X2 and further can be to X1, X2 upto XN. So Linear regression algorithm will try to find Weights for each of the X

    **Y = W0 + W1X1 + W2X2 + W3X3 ......**

    **W0 is called Intercept**
    **W1 .. Wn are called Coefficient**
