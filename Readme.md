## Motivation

I want to learn Machine learning from scratch. 

## Setup

### Install python

I am using Python3.11

### Create virtual Environment

Virtual Environments are good ways to keep dependencies isolated. Run the command in your desired working folder. 

    `python -m venv ./`

Activate the virtual environment

    `.\Scripts\activate`

### Libraries 

Install scikit-learn

    `pip install scikit-learn`

I will be updating more dependecies as required.

## Introduction

Machine learning can be divided into 3 parts.
1. Supervised ML
2. Unsupervised ML
3. Reinforcement ML

### Supervised ML


### Unsupervised ML
